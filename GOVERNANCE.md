## Contribution

> [!NOTE]
> [No Clocks, LLC](https://github.com/noclocks) strives to be an open and inclusive community. We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of their experience and want to recognize that everyone's contributions are valuable.

- **All contributions to the organization's open-source projects are subject to the rules and guidelines outlined in the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).**

## Roles and Responsibilities

We recognize different levels of contribution as four different Contributor Levels. Because each level comes with a new set of privileges and responsibilities, you may also see these levels referred to as Contributor Roles.

Contributor levels are available to all members of the Astro community, regardless of coding skill or experience.

Two important things that we look for in a contributor are:

Being here - Everyone's time is valuable, and the fact that you're here and contributing to Astro is amazing! Thank you for being a part of this project with us.
Being a positive member of our community - Go above and beyond our Code of Conduct and commit to healthy communication across pull requests, issue discussions, Discord conversations, and any interactions outside of our community
