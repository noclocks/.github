## Overview

This repository contains the default [Community Health Files](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file) for all of [No Clocks, LLC](https://github.com/noclocks) open-source projects.

These files are used to provide a consistent experience across all of our projects, and to make it easier for contributors to understand how to contribute to our projects.

## About

Default community health files are a set of predefined files that provide guidance and templates for maintaining a healthy and collaborative open source project. You can add default community health files to a public repository called .github, in the root of the repository or in the docs or .github folders. These files help you automate and standardize various aspects of your project's development and community interaction. They are essential for promoting transparency, good practices, and collaboration in open source projects.

GitHub will use and display default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- The repository root
- The [`.github`](./.github/) folder
- The [`docs`](./docs/) folder

For example, if you have a repository with no `CONTRIBUTING` file, GitHub will use the default `CONTRIBUTING` file from here. If you create a custom `CONTRIBUTING` file in the repository, GitHub will use that file instead of the default file.

> [!WARNING]
> If a repository has any files in its own [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/) folder, including issue templates or a `config.yml` file, none of the contents of the default [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/) folder will be used.

As a repository maintainer, you can use the community standards checklist to see if your project meets the recommended community standards to help people use and contribute to your project. For more information, see [About community profiles for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories).
